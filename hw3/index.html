        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <p>
          I am very sensitive to details, I can feel the slight mood changes in
          other people, especially close ones. It makes me feel the same way
          they do. I absolutely hate it sometimes. Still I believe it is better
          to feel rather than not feel.

          recipe two years ago. Everyone in my family love the cookies I make.

          My grandmother. She raised me ever since my first breath while mom was
          busy making money. I absolutely love her. Even a single thought about
          her leaving one day makes me cry.

          My mom. She has been through so much and she is still doing great. We
          have our own misunderstandings sometimes, but of course I love her
          always and she loves me. I am grateful to her for everything I have.

          Chloe Price. She is a videogame character from "Life is Strange". I
          feel like she would understand me.

      <h3>Wishes</h3>
      <p>
        There are things which I think about a lot, which I try to escape in
        many ways. I hate to think about them, but I do anyways. I hope to
        overcome them and begin to love and accept myself. I hope my family
        stays healthy and happy. I hope to surround myself with people who will
        genuinely love me and support me.
